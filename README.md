# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering focuses on design, development, testing and maintance of software whereas traditional programming focuses on writing, testing and updating codes

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 -Problem recognition 
 -Problem defination
 -Program design
 -Program development
 -Testing and debbuging of program
 -Implementation and maintenance of program
 -Program documentation

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 -Problem recognition :programmers search for problems to be solved
 -Problem defination :Problems encountered are discussed and possible solutions are developed
 -Program design : Structures are developed on how the solutions will overcome the problem
 -Program development : Code is written using appropriate programming languages
 -Testing and debbuging of program :The code written is tested to see if its working properly and debugged using   various methods eg; dry run,desk checking etc.
 -Implementation and maintenance of program :The program is ready for use abd supplied to consumer
 -Program documentation : A manual on how to use the program/ software is created for the user

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 
*Agile offers a nonconsecutive approach while waterfall model is sequential and linear approach where one project has to be completed before moving to the next one.
*Consider Agile if your project has dynamic requirements, needs frequent client feedback, and values adaptability. Choose Waterfall for projects with well-defined requirements, limited client involvement during development, and where a structured approach is necessary.

Requirements Engineering: 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.*Requirements engineering is the process of defining,documenting and maintaining requiurements in the engineering  desinging process
*PROCESS

Output: Validated and verified requirements.
Management:

Objective: Track and manage changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
Methods: Change control processes, traceability matrices, version control.
Output: Updated and managed requirements documentation.

*Importance in the Software Development Lifecycle
Alignment with Stakeholder Needs:

Ensures that the final product meets the expectations and needs of stakeholders, including users, customers, and regulatory bodies.
Foundation for Design and Development:

Provides a clear and detailed blueprint for developers and designers, guiding the subsequent phases of the software development lifecycle.
Risk Management:

Identifies potential issues and ambiguities early in the project, reducing the risk of costly changes and rework later in the development process.
Improved Communication:

Facilitates better communication among project stakeholders, including developers, testers, and business analysts, ensuring a shared understanding of requirements.
Scope Management:

Helps in managing the project scope, preventing scope creep by maintaining a clear and controlled set of requirements.
Quality Assurance:

Ensures that the software meets quality standards and performs as expected through validation and verification activities.
Cost and Time Efficiency:

By providing a clear roadmap and reducing ambiguities, RE helps in estimating costs and timelines more accurately and avoiding delays and budget overruns.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
-Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, self-contained components, or modules, each of which encapsulates a specific piece of functionality. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, yet they work together to form a complete system.
*Improving Maintainability
Isolation of Changes:
Changes in one module have minimal impact on other modules due to low coupling. This isolation simplifies the identification and implementation of changes.
Simplified Testing:
Modules can be tested independently (unit testing), ensuring that individual parts function correctly before integration. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs.
Enhanced Debugging:
When issues arise, it's easier to pinpoint the problem within a specific module rather than sifting through a monolithic codebase.
*Improved Readability:
Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and navigate, making the codebase more accessible for new developers.
Reusability:
Modules can often be reused across different parts of the system or even in different projects, reducing duplication of effort and increasing consistency.
Improving Scalability
Parallel Development:
Different teams can work on different modules concurrently without causing conflicts, accelerating the development process and enabling the project to scale more efficiently.
Independent Deployment:
In microservices architectures, for example, modules (or services) can be deployed independently, allowing for more flexible scaling of specific parts of the system based on demand.
Resource Allocation:
Modules can be allocated resources based on their specific needs, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
Flexibility in Technology Choices:
Different modules can be implemented using different technologies that best suit their requirements, facilitating scalability through the use of the most appropriate tools and frameworks.
Load Distribution:
The system can distribute the load across multiple servers or instances by scaling modules independently, enhancing performance and reliability.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.EG git

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software project manager's responsibilities are to analyze project constraints, establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams, construct the project timelines and monitor the project's key performance indicators.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Privacy and Data Protection:

Issue: Handling sensitive user data and ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.
Example: Collecting user data without consent or improperly securing personal information leading to data breaches.
Intellectual Property:

Issue: Respecting the intellectual property rights of others, including software licenses and copyrighted material.
Example: Using open-source code in proprietary software without adhering to the licensing terms.
Quality and Reliability:

Issue: Ensuring that software is reliable, safe, and free of defects.
Example: Releasing software that has not been adequately tested, leading to failures or harm.
Algorithmic Bias:

Issue: Designing algorithms that may unintentionally discriminate against certain groups.
Example: An AI recruitment tool that is biased against a particular gender or ethnicity.
